# Credit Card Number Validator
This program uses the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) to validate the validity of a credit card number. It only works on American Express, Visa, and most MasterCard credit card numbers.

I originally wrote this program to complete a problem set for [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) course offered by Harvard University. A full blog post about this program can be found [here](https://chancej715.github.io/posts/credit/credit.html).
